[93mWARNING [0m:   DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.client.start_numpy_client() is deprecated. 
	Instead, use `flwr.client.start_client()` by ensuring you first call the `.to_client()` method as shown below: 
	flwr.client.start_client(
		server_address='<IP>:<PORT>',
		client=FlowerClient().to_client(), # <-- where FlowerClient is of type flwr.client.NumPyClient object
	)
	Using `start_numpy_client()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.
        
[93mWARNING [0m:   DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.client.start_client() is deprecated.

		$ flower-supernode --insecure --superlink='<IP>:<PORT>'

	To view all available options, run:

		$ flower-supernode --help

	Using `start_client()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
