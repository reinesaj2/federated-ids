# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates target the `main` branch. Release branches inherit fixes as part of regular backports when applicable.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not file a public issue.**
2. Email the maintainers at `security@reinesaj.org` with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
   - Affected configurations (dataset, parameters, etc.)
3. You will receive an acknowledgement within 2 business days.

## Disclosure Process

- Maintainers will investigate, develop a fix, and coordinate a release.
- You will be kept informed about progress and timelines.
- Once patched, a public advisory will summarize impact, workaround, and remediation steps.

## Scope

This policy covers all code in the repository, including experimental scripts, provided they are part of the distributed artifacts or CI workflows.
