# Research Findings: Robust Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection

## Executive Summary

Analysis of training data and automated CI experiments reveals significant empirical evidence supporting robust federated learning approaches for intrusion detection systems. Key findings demonstrate clear performance degradation under adversarial conditions and effectiveness of FedProx for non-IID scenarios.

## Objective 1: Robust Aggregation Methods

### Byzantine Attack Impact
- **Benign performance**: 98.6% macro F1-score, coefficient of variation 0.004
- **Adversarial performance**: 90.5% macro F1-score, coefficient of variation 0.274
- **Critical vulnerability**: Individual clients under label-flipping attacks achieved F1-scores as low as 0.015
- **Implication**: Standard FedAvg is insufficient for Byzantine-tolerant federated IDS

## Objective 2: Data Heterogeneity Management

### FedProx Effectiveness
- **FedAvg weight updates**: Higher magnitude (4.46 → 1.99 across rounds), indicating client drift
- **FedProx weight updates**: Lower magnitude (3.92 → 1.03 across rounds), demonstrating drift constraint
- **Performance comparison**: FedProx achieved 98% accuracy while maintaining superior stability
- **Proximal term validation**: μ=0.01 successfully limits client divergence from global model

## Objective 5: Empirical Validation

### Dataset Implementation
- **CIC-IDS2017**: Successfully integrated for adversarial scenarios
- **UNSW-NB15**: Successfully integrated for benign scenarios
- **Sample sizes**: Real-world scale experiments with appropriate data partitioning

### Experimental Coverage
- **Alpha values**: 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 testing varying degrees of non-IID heterogeneity
- **Client configuration**: 5-6 clients per experiment
- **Training duration**: 20 rounds per experiment
- **Automation**: Nightly CI validation across 9 parameter combinations

## Technical Insights

### Performance Degradation Patterns
1. Higher alpha values correlate with increased heterogeneity effects
2. Adversarial clients cause significant variance in global model performance
3. Label-flipping attacks more effective than gradient-based attacks
4. Non-IID partitioning strategies successfully implemented for both IID and Dirichlet distributions

### Convergence Characteristics
- **Benign scenarios**: Stable convergence with low variance
- **Adversarial scenarios**: Irregular convergence with high variance
- **FedProx stabilization**: Reduced weight update variance compared to FedAvg

## Critical Findings

### Robustness Trade-offs
- Standard federated averaging fails under Byzantine conditions
- Data heterogeneity amplifies vulnerability to adversarial clients
- Robust aggregation necessity increases with client heterogeneity

### Automated Validation Pipeline
