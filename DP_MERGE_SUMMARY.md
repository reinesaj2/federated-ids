# DP Accounting Merge - Completion Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Branch:** exp/issue-44-comprehensive-experiments  
**Commit:** e3fe77c

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Proper Branch Hygiene (COMPLETED)
- Merged `feat/dp-epsilon-accounting-issue-45` → `milestone/m2-privacy-security` 
- Merged `milestone/m2-privacy-security` → `exp/issue-44-comprehensive-experiments`
- **All tests passing: 22/22** (client metrics + privacy accounting)

### 2. DP Implementation Upgraded
**Before:**
- Simple `compute_epsilon()` function
- No state tracking across rounds
- DP metrics: dp_epsilon, dp_delta, dp_sigma, dp_clip_norm

**After (DPAccountant class):**
```python
from privacy_accounting import DPAccountant

# Stateful privacy budget tracking
self.dp_accountant = DPAccountant(delta=1e-5)
self.dp_accountant.step(noise_multiplier=sigma, sample_rate=1.0)
epsilon = self.dp_accountant.get_epsilon()
```

**Benefits:**
- Cumulative epsilon tracking across FL rounds (proper composition)
- Reset capability when DP enabled/disabled dynamically
- Full test coverage (10 tests in test_privacy_accounting.py)
- Proper Renyi DP accounting using Opacus

### 3. Experiment Cleanup
- **Deleted:** 5 broken DP experiments (all had catastrophic F1=0.067-0.126)
- **Remaining:** 197 experiments (down from 202)
- **Reason:** Old experiments used broken DP implementation from Issue #83

## Current Experimental Status

### Publishable Dimensions (3/5)

#### [PASS] 1. Attack Resilience (BEST RESULT)
- **Coverage:** 40 experiments (10% and 30% adversaries)
- **Key Finding:** Bulyan maintains 59-64% F1 while FedAvg degrades to 39-42%
- **Status:** Publication-ready

#### [PASS] 2. Heterogeneity Impact  
- **Coverage:** 145 experiments across alpha in {0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, inf}
- **Issue:** High variance (F1: 0.415-1.000) needs investigation
- **Status:** Acceptable after variance check

#### [WEAK] 3. Aggregation Comparison
- **Coverage:** 145 experiments
- **Issue:** ANOVA p=0.4136 (no significant differences)
- **Status:** Weak but publishable as null result

### Problematic Dimensions (2/5)

#### [FAIL] 4. Privacy-Utility Tradeoff
- **Coverage:** 0 experiments (deleted all 5 broken ones)
- **Previous issue:** 87-93% performance collapse
- **Next step:** Rerun with proper DPAccountant and tuned noise levels

#### [INCOMPLETE] 5. Personalization Benefit
- **Coverage:** 10 experiments (insufficient)
- **Issue:** Plot generation failed (empty dataframes)
- **Next step:** Run 30-50 more experiments

## Next Steps

### Option A: Ship 3 Dimensions (Conservative - Recommended)
```bash
# Focus thesis on:
1. Attack Resilience (lead with this!)
2. Heterogeneity Impact
3. Aggregation Comparison (acknowledge null result)

# Timeline: Ready for QCHECK now
```

### Option B: Complete All 5 Dimensions (Ambitious)
```bash
# 1. Rerun DP experiments with proper implementation
# Recommended noise levels: sigma in {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0}
# (NOT 1.01 which was too high)

python scripts/run_experiments.py \
  --dimension privacy \
  --dp_noise_multipliers "0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5,1.0" \
  --seeds "42,43,44,45,46" \
  --dataset cic

# Estimated: 25 configs x 5 seeds = 125 experiments (~6-8 hours)

# 2. Run more personalization experiments
python scripts/run_experiments.py \
  --dimension personalization \
  --personalization_epochs "0,3,5" \
  --seeds "42,43,44,45,46"

# Estimated: 15 configs x 5 seeds = 75 experiments (~4-6 hours)

# Total additional time: 10-14 hours
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Merged Files
- `client.py` - DPAccountant integration, DP noise injection
- `client_metrics.py` - Added dp_epsilon, dp_delta, dp_enabled columns
- `privacy_accounting.py` - Full DPAccountant class (165 LOC)
- `test_privacy_accounting.py` - 10 comprehensive tests
- `test_client_metrics.py` - Updated for new columns

### Resolved Conflicts
1. **Import statements:** Combined `DPAccountant` + `compute_epsilon`
2. **Metrics columns:** Merged DP accounting + SecureAgg fields
3. **DP logic:** Kept stateful DPAccountant over simple function
4. **Tests:** Updated expected column headers

### Test Coverage
```
test_client_metrics.py ............      [12/12 PASSED]
test_privacy_accounting.py ..........   [10/10 PASSED]
Total: 22/22 tests passing
```

## Recommendations

**My strong recommendation: Option A (Ship 3 dimensions NOW)**

**Rationale:**
1. Attack resilience alone is thesis-worthy
2. Including broken DP results (F1=0.10) raises more questions than having no DP
3. Can document privacy/personalization as "Future Work"
4. Thesis deadline > perfectionism

**If you choose Option B:**
- Budget 12-16 hours for experiments + validation
- Risk: New DP implementation could still have issues
- Reward: Complete 5-dimension thesis
